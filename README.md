## <a id="project-overview"></a>📖 Project Overview
<!-- ## 📖 Project Overview -->

**ScoreIQ** aims to understand and predict student performance in mathematics. By analyzing features such as gender, ethnicity, parental education level, and test preparation, it builds a model that provides an accurate estimate of a student's math score.

The application is a production-ready machine learning system with a Neo-Minimalist web interface, user authentication (email/password + GitHub OAuth), and prediction history — both session-based for anonymous users and database-backed for registered accounts.

## <a id="features"></a>✨ Features
<!-- ## ✨ Features -->

-   **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes regression models to predict student math scores.
-   **Comprehensive EDA**: Detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and relationships in the data.
-   **Multi-Model Evaluation**: Trains and evaluates several models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, CatBoost, AdaBoost, and K-Neighbors) to select the best performer.

### ML Pipeline Workflow

1.  **Data Ingestion (`data_ingestion.py`)**:
    -   Reads the raw data from `notebooks/data/stud.csv`.
    -   Splits the data into training and testing sets.
    -   Saves the raw, train, and test CSVs into the `artifacts/` directory.
    -   Triggers the data transformation and model training steps.

2.  **Data Transformation (`data_transformation.py`)**:
    -   Creates a preprocessing pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`.
    -   Applies `StandardScaler` to numerical features and `OneHotEncoder` to categorical features.
    -   Saves the fitted preprocessor object as `preprocessor.pkl` for later use.

3.  **Model Training (`model_trainer.py`)**:
    -   Receives the transformed data.
    -   Runs a suite of regression models through `GridSearchCV` to find the best model and hyperparameters.
    -   Selects the model with the highest R² score (minimum threshold of 0.6).
    -   Saves the best-performing model as `model.pkl`.

4.  **Prediction (`prediction_pipeline.py` & `application.py`)**:
    -   The Flask app captures user input from the web form.
    -   The `PredictPipeline` loads the saved `preprocessor.pkl` and `model.pkl`.
    -   It transforms the new input data and feeds it to the model to generate a prediction, which is then displayed to the user.

<!-- ## 🚀 Getting Started -->

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoJo-Rika/Student-Performance-Prediction-System.git
cd Student-Performance-Prediction-System
```

### Step 2: Set Up The Environment and Install Dependencies
We recommend using `uv`, a fast, next-generation Python package manager, for setup.

#### Recommended Approach (using `uv`)
1.  **Install `uv`** on your system if you haven't already.
    ```bash
    # On macOS and Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

    # On Windows
    powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies** with a single command:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    This command automatically creates a `.venv` folder in your project directory and installs all listed packages from `requirements.txt`.

    > **Note**: For a comprehensive guide on `uv`, check out this detailed tutorial: [uv-tutorial-guide](https://github.com/GoJo-Rika/uv-tutorial-guide).

#### Alternative Approach (using `venv` and `pip`)
If you prefer to use the standard `venv` and `pip`:
1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Using uv: uv add -r requirements.txt
    ```

## <a id="running-the-application"></a>👟 Running the Application
<!-- ## 👟 Running the Application -->

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Step 1: Run the Training Pipeline

Before you can run the web application for the first time, you need to train the model. This will generate the necessary `model.pkl` and `preprocessor.pkl` files in the `artifacts/` directory.

```bash
python src/components/data_ingestion.py     # Using uv: uv run src/components/data_ingestion.py
```

This single command will execute the entire training workflow: data ingestion, transformation, and model training.

### Step 2: Start the Prediction Server

Once the training is complete and the artifacts are saved, start the Flask web server:

```bash
python application.py   # Using uv: uv run application.py
```

### Step 3: Access the Web App

Open your web browser and navigate to:
**http://127.0.0.1:5000**

You can now use the form to input student data and get a math score prediction.

## <a id="jupyter-notebooks"></a>🧪 Jupyter Notebooks
<!-- ## 🧪 Jupyter Notebooks -->

The `notebooks/` directory contains two key notebooks that document the project's development:

1.  **`1 . EDA STUDENT PERFORMANCE .ipynb`**: This notebook contains a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the student dataset, including visualizations and key insights that informed the feature engineering and model selection process.
2.  **`2. MODEL TRAINING.ipynb`**: This notebook shows the initial model training and evaluation experiments. It serves as a scratchpad for testing different models and preprocessing steps before they were refactored into the main `src` pipeline.

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>🐛 Troubleshooting
<!-- ## 🐛 Troubleshooting -->

**Common Issues:**
1. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Data not found**: Check `notebooks/data/stud.csv` exists
3. **Model not found**: Run training pipeline first
4. **Prediction errors**: Check input data format

**Debugging:**
- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Custom exceptions provide detailed error context
- Use logging output for pipeline debugging
